# SmartVision

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Welcome to SmartVision! This is a project that I have been working on for a while now. It is a computer vision project that uses a Raspberry Pi and a camera to detect objects in real-time. The project is built using Python and OpenCV. The project is still in development and I am constantly adding new features to it. The project is open-source and you can find the code on this GitHub page as more features get added. I hope you enjoy the project and find it useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. Thank you for visiting my project!
