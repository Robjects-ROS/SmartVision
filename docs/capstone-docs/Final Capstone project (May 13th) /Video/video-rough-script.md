### Timeline X: Explanation, intention and reasoning of using

A eye” after testing the second items, it's time to move on to my next step of conquering AI for more practical solutions, so I went back to the whiteboard/paper.

I needed a real problem to solve, because what use is detecting these garbage items that really served no practical application.


I mean, come on look at it!
[showsi,mage ]
Would you really believe that is toilet paper?
(add clown sound effect)

And, what even is that???????????

Like come on…
Like come on…
Who the **** even say this is a zip top can in regular every day jargon?

I've never once heard of a zip top can before, nor have I ever in my entire life imagined it would look like this.

And that's not even the least of it. Another problem is the fact that these labels are are just plain silly.

Now take a look at these now take a look at this object and you tell me it's not a Lego... but it's tablets. Tablets.

Excuse me, expired tablets.

**cough cough

So it would be fair to say that these pictures can be removed from the data set. Our point is to make machine more practical it's better to small number of quality pictures versus a large number of bad image an image label. 

Let's go ahead and put it away for now, he might be able to make a more creative, unique solution if we try to isolate a unique object down the far future.

- Number two reason:

And another reason for that matter, if you mind doesn't, I identify objects but pretty and imaginary label visually seen an item.

No, human mind the object then undergo psychological processes, most of the time without conscious thought. 


Instead, humans more than likely see an item, categorize it as important or non-important with a huge bias on how they reacted to similar objects in the past, with some variations, depending on emotional and mental state.


For example, when I see a soda can, my mind immediately follows the hard ingrain brain processes for other apathy and slight aversion because I had done this for the last several years every time a soda comes up since I couldn't care much for it since I don't drink it.

It's the path of least resistance that the brain usually takes so it can exert more mental energy, on rewarding, but not necessarily healthier/better activities such as catching up on the latest memes

Has the brain just craves more dopamine and will definitely find it hard to pursue activities that the gate from that fact.

### transition to current proposal

Although this seems like a negative fact and a crucial flaw in humanity, it actually is one the thing that differentiates us from AI. AI doesn't reflect on emotional basis, and doesn't it make decisions without prior programming. It can't create art, it can only imitate what it has been trained on. And knowing this. And, knowing that fact is incredible power and is a great mindset to begin using AI FOR you and not AGAINST you.


Anyways, those that are studying data science or have more technical experience with the new emerging of AI, might have already began to break down that not everything is AI. Rather, when you are first studying data science, you might notice that data science is broken down and smaller segments specifically into the categories of AI.


Ironically, what I am working with isn't AI, but rather is machine learning where... [ quick intro on learning of the areas of ai]
