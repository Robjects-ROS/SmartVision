# Advanced feature Implementation
Currently, the projects stands to only detect color detection, and utilizes edge detection to create isolated geometrics that signify the color of the object. To improve the project, I will be implementing further advanced features to the existing project. 
The main focus of the advanced feature implementation is to detect the other faces of the cube, which include a full set of 20 2-d pictures of real-life objects, such as a car, a dog, a cat, a house, a tree, a person, etc. 

My advanced feature implementation will
be submitted as a PDF document, which will include the following:
- a description of the advanced feature implementation
- methodology of the advanced feature implementation
- configuration code to load the models pre-trained on the advanced feature implementation
- code running camera in real-time, which captures the images that detects, recognizes, and classifies the objects with basic OpenCV annotations (rectangle, circle, etc.)
